# 455-Project

Tuckers Music Outlets is a database project designed to mimic an employee's work screen created for a database management class (CSC 455, UNCW, Spring 2016).

The SQL files included in the repository were created for the project but never used. The final SQL statements needed were written into the PHP files.
